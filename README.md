# Nitrassic
Nitrassic is a JavaScript engine for .NET; it uses no native or unsafe marked code so it is suitable for use in e.g Unity3D. It exchanges some ECMAScript 5 compliance for speed - this engine is currently less compliant than the original Jurassic engine it is a derivative of and instead executes code considerably faster.

# Current Status
Nitrassic is currently under heavy development so please do not use it in a release; Use Jurassic instead. At the moment, it is only expected to run small pieces of code whilst the type tracker is still being constructed.

# Why the name 'Nitrassic'?
The name is a combination of 'Nitro' and 'Jurassic'. 'Nitro' was the name of our previous internal JavaScript engine which was fast but not very compliant. Nitrassic intends to combine Jurassic's compliance with the speed of Nitro.
